        <p>I am a registered nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I obtained my BSN from California State University, San Bernardino
          in 2015, where I graduated Suma Cum Laude. Shortly after, I sat for the NCLEX and passed on the first attempt, earning my California
          State Nursing License. Soon after, I began work at the Loma Linda VA Medical Center as Med/Surg Nurse on 3SE. I quickly rose through
          the ranks becoming certified in SDU and next, a Charge Nurse. It wasn't long before I became the Assistant Nurse Manager of the unit.
          Next, I attended Grand Canyon Univeristy where I earned my MSN in Leadership in Healthcare Administration with and Emphasis in Servant
          Leadership. During the COVID-19 Pandemic I was hand selected to establish our facilities deployment plan for the COVID-19 vaccine.
          Currently, I am working on switching careers to become a developer.<p />
